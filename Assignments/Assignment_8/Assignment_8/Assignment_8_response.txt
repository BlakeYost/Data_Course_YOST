Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
Yes, they are statistically non-significant. 

In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
Yes, in my final model, it is not quite linear.

Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

m1 <- glm(data=df,
     formula = predictor ~ response)
summary(m1)
